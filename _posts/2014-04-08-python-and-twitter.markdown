I intended to use Twitter's API with Python, since a while.  
There's a lot of library listed [in the documentation][twitter-dev-lib]. But, I encountered a lot of bugs/problem/whatever with each of them.

I think that the best, and the most flexible way for using Twitter's API with Python, is by using [oauthlib][oauthlib] or [rauth][rauth].  
Now, everything works.

[rauth]: https://github.com/litl/rauth "rauth"
